# Euler
This repository consist of my answers to problems presented by [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).

## Constraints
My solutions will be in the form of small programs. The programs are written in C, compiled with GCC (currently version 13.3.0), with makefiles presented for GNU make. The setup is developed and tested on a Linux system, but should translate to Windows with little effort.

## Repository organisation
Each problem will have its own subfolder with a sepperate ReadMe-file that introduces the problem, considerations to take into account, and present the solution(s).
